// The following generates the default grids provided by the css version of the square grid
+grid-system

// But most compass users prefer to construct semantic layouts like so (two column layout with header and footer):
#wrapper
  +grid-wrapper
  #container
    +grid-container
    #header, #footer
      +grid(18)
    #sidebar
      +grid-width(6)
    #main-content
      +grid-width(12)
